## Chinese Remainder Theorem(CRT) and residue number system

We can reduce the size of large integers by calculating the modulus with respect to a few coprime integers and 
then perform calculations with the remainders(residues) that are more difficult than the large integers. 
Once the calculations are doen we can use an interpolation formula to convert back to the larger integer
and get the result. This will be lossless as long as the product of the coprime integers is larger than the original 
large integer.



## Verilog Projects

1. Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder.
2. Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and update information about your project, paying special attention to the `source_files` and `top_module` properties. If you are upgrading an existing Tiny Tapeout project, check out our [online info.yaml migration tool](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tt-yaml-upgrade-tool/).
3. Edit [docs/info.md](docs/info.md) and add a description of your project.
4. Optionally, add a testbench to the `test` folder. See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more information.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/).
